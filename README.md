# review_gen

this is a project where i am having a go at training a transformer model from scratch (it will be very very small) based on a meme idea of generating restaurant reviews in trendy areas.

this will make hipsters obsolete.

## scrape_reviews

there is a scraping script to "borrow" data from a popular large tech company in the scrape_reviews directory. you will need to install chromium/the chromium driver. just read the code if you want to use this.

its not perfect but also not horrible. it works but don't expect too much in terms of resilience or performance. for a test run of mine for 150 restaurants generated by the overpass script in the other directory, it scraped all the reviews just fine apart from some restaurants that have been closed.

## train

basic training script. just run it

## generate

wrapper for simple prompting
